This is my first attempt to create a size responsive web page before any study of responsive web design (using only css).
Please pardon any wrong hack used as I'm just a beginner yet.
One can comment out the backgrounds to get the actual look of website.

see https://the-rdt.github.io/concept-design/ for site with complete background properties to see each div area

see https://concept-design-with-bootstrap.netlify.app/ for design with bootstrap
